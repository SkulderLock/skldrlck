			"description": "Bringing even more intimacy to the Spoons position, the Wrapped variation involves the woman wrapping and hooking her legs around her partner's. Although a more subtle looking variation, there are a few noteworthy effects; she can now squeeze her legs to achieve deeper penetration, it opens her legs for easier access to her clit for either partner to play with, and tilts her pelvis for a different angle of penetration.",

Even in the supported variations, the man needs to support a good portion of the woman's weight, while doing all the thrusting... which can be tiring enough on its own. If the woman isn't confident that she can hold herself up through an orgasm, we recommend starting at a lower altitude or supported, and having some pillows placed for backup just in case.",

However, the reduced physical strain comes at the cost of quite a bit of mobility. Since it can be much more difficult to get full penetration distance from a sitting position, we recommend some pillows under the man's rear to help increase his range, and to transition into a standing variation when your stamina allows for it.",

With the crab posture being rather taxing on a woman's upper body, men should do what they can to help lift her by the hips, as well as thrust from below for increased penetration range.",

Consequently, it may be better suited for men to receive anal penetration from below. For those wanting to try the vaginal form, we recommend transitioning into it from the 180 or the Grounded variations, and taking it slow to avoid risking injury.",
